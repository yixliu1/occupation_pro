<h2>Requirements for Skills Assessment</h2>
<p>ICT Business Development Manager is classified as Group B occupations by Vetassess. The criteria for skills assessment of Group B occupations are the following :</p>
<li>Qualification(s) assessed at AQF Bachelor degree or higher degree with a highly relevant field of study and at least one year of post-qualification highly relevant employment in the last five years; </li>
<li>Qualification(s) assessed at AQF Bachelor degree or higher degree with an additional qualification at least Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) Diploma level in a highly relevant field of study and at least two years of post qualification highly relevant employment in the last five years; </li>
<li>Qualification(s) assessed at AQF Bachelor degree or higher degree without a highly relevant field of study and at least three years of post-qualification highly relevant employment in the last five years;</li>
<p>According to Vetassess, if you have pre-qualification employment and if all of your employment is before your qualification assessed at the AQF bachelor degree level , you are required to have five years of highly relevant employment in addition to at least one year of highly relevant employment at an appropriate skill level completed in the last five years.</p>
<p>As stated on the Vetassess website, an ICT Business Development Manager identifies and generates new ICT business opportunities to further improve market share and awareness by gaining an understanding of customers' ICT needs and promoting goods and services to these customers. May manage some key customer accounts. Highly relevant fields of study would include disciplines relevant to information and communication products, such as computer science and information technology. Other major fields of study such as marketing, accounting, or finance will be considered on a case-by-case basis if the employment is highly relevant and there is a clear connection between the major field of study and the products/services sold. The ICT products sold are typically targeted at enterprise (corporate) or public sectors and would normally be expected to constitute business solutions rather than be off-the-shelf products. The role requires in-depth, specialised knowledge in ICT to assess the needs of client organisations, explain the goods and services in detail, and engage in appropriate reporting and business planning. The role of a Business Development Manager is primarily to acquire new business/accounts, rather than to generate increased revenue from existing accounts. ICT Sales Assistants, who sell computing and telecommunications-related goods and services in retail and wholesale establishments, are elsewhere classified in ANZSCO at a lower skill level than ICT Sales Professionals.</p>
