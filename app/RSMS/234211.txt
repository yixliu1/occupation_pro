<p>According to Vetassess, a Chemist studies the chemical and physical properties of substances, and develops and monitors chemical processes and production (ANZSCO). Chemistry (or Chemical Sciences) is the study of the composition, structure, chemical reactions and transformations of matter (ASCED). A major in Chemistry would include subjects such as analytical, physical, organic and inorganic chemistry with an additional focus on modern applications such as nanotechnology, analytical and environmental chemistry, polymer science and surface science. Qualifications in Pharmacy, Food Science or Food Technology do not usually have the breadth and depth of Chemistry-related subjects to be considered positive for this occupation. This occupation should not be confused with 251512 Industrial Pharmacist, who undertakes research, testing and analysis related to the development, production, storage, quality control and distribution of drugs and related supplies.</p>
